# DiscordingNotes
A regroupment of all assets and themes i have made/used in past projects.
 Fonts used for the project as well as alternate fonts for the themes can be found in the font folder.
 In order to select/use a theme, you need to get the .theme file and put it into the Theme folder in Betterdiscord, not the code file.
